# markdown-to-blockstyle-json

This is a simple tool to convert a markdown string to blockstyle json.

It will make sure that any image will be a block on it's own and pushed out of a paragraph (or any other element)
You will end up with a flat and none-heirachical list of blocks such as paragraph, image, list, code, table, etc.
One should fairly easily be able to manipulate and reconstruct html through those blocks.
